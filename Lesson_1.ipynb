It is well suited for a bottom-up approach when building larger projects.\n\n### 1. Basic usage\n* click ```new``` to create a new python 3 notebook\n* write codes like you usually do in text editors, and press ```shift+return``` to run the code. It will return the results or errors under the cell.\n* in front of every cell, there is an in [ ] sign, the number in [ ] means the sequences of cells, and if there is * in [], means that this cell is still running, you can either wait it finish or click ```stop``` under the kernel to exit from the running,pressing I twice will also do the trick.\n* kernel. ```kernel``` is a tool for interactive input and output all the things you did from the beginning. By clicking ```restart```, you can give a variable another value.\n* saving the notebook as other format, you can click```file``` and ```download as``` to choose your target format.\n\n### 2. Short Cut\n* run this cell: **ctrl + enter**\n* enter edit mode : **enter**\n* exit edit mode : **esc**\n\n    **under the command mode**\n* convert to makedown: **M**\n* insert cell above: **A**\n* insert cell below: **B**\n* delete this cell: **DD**\n* find and replace: **F**\n\n### 3. Advance tips\n* help document: add ? before function\n    > ? numpy.sort()\n* magic command: [build-in function](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) of jupyter notebook\n* tab: code implement"
